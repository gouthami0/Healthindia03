<p>There are several similarities between a panic attack and an anxiety attack. But anxiety is often triggered by certain stressors and may build gradually. On the other hand, panic attacks can occur unexpectedly and abruptly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You might hear people talking about panic attacks and anxiety attacks like they’re the same thing. But they’re different conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Read on to find out more about the differences between panic attacks and anxiety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What is an anxiety attack?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition” (DSM-5) does not mention anxiety attacks, but it does define&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety">anxiety</a>&nbsp;as a feature of a number of common psychiatric disorders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://psychiatry.org/patients-families/anxiety-disorders/what-are-anxiety-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">includes</a>&nbsp;the following conditions:</p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anxiety is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">usually relatedTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;to the anticipation of a stressful situation, experience, or event. It may come on gradually.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Symptoms of anxiety include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>worry</li><li>distress</li><li>fear</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lack of diagnostic recognition of anxiety attacks means that the signs and symptoms are open to interpretation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is, a person may describe having an “anxiety attack” and have symptoms that another person has never experienced despite indicating that they, too, have had an “anxiety attack.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What is a panic attack?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/panic-attack">Panic attacks</a>&nbsp;come on suddenly and involve intense and often overwhelming fear. They’re&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430973/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accompaniedTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;by very challenging physical symptoms, like a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, or nausea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DSM-5 recognizes panic attacks and categorizes them as unexpected or expected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unexpected panic attacks occur without an obvious cause. Expected panic attacks are cued by external stressors, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/phobia-simple-specific">phobias</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Panic attacks can happen to anyone, but having more than one may be a sign of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/panic-disorder">panic disorder</a>, a mental health condition characterized by sudden and repeated panic attacks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Symptoms of panic attack vs. anxiety attack</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Panic and anxiety attacks may feel similar, and they share a lot of emotional and physical symptoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can experience both an anxiety and a panic attack at the same time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, you might experience anxiety while worrying about a potentially stressful situation, like an important presentation at work. When the situation arrives, anxiety may culminate in a panic attack.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It may be difficult to know whether what you’re experiencing is anxiety or a panic attack. Keep in mind the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>The cause:</strong>&nbsp;Anxiety is typically related to something that’s perceived as stressful or threatening. Panic attacks aren’t always cued by stressors. They&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/panic-disorder-when-fear-overwhelms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most oftenTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;occur out of the blue.</li><li><strong>The level of distress:</strong>&nbsp;Anxiety can be mild, moderate, or severe. For example, anxiety may be happening in the back of your mind as you go about your day-to-day activities. Panic attacks, on the other hand, mostly involve severe, disruptive symptoms.</li><li><strong>Fight-or-flight:</strong>&nbsp;During a panic attack, the body’s autonomous fight-or-flight response takes over. Physical symptoms are often more intense than symptoms of anxiety.</li><li><strong>Speed of onset:</strong>&nbsp;While anxiety can build gradually, panic attacks usually come on abruptly.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong>&nbsp;Panic attacks typically trigger worries or fears related to having another attack. This may have an effect on your behavior, leading you to avoid places or situations where you think you might be at risk of a panic attack.</li></ul>
